      <p class="mb-4">
        Starting as an intern at Backbone PLM, I immersed myself in web development alongside my traditional CS education. 
        Now I'm a full stack engineer at Bamboo Rose, the parent company of Backbone PLM, since graduating from CSU in May 2023.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">
        Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I play drums for Avalanche and Nuggets games, love to rock climb, 
        golf, ski, and hike.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">
        I'm always striving to improve my skills and learn new things. I pride myself on being a natural leader, learning 
        new things extremely quickly, and communicating effectively.
