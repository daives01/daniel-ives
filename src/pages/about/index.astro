          I started as an intern at Backbone PLM while finishing my CS degree at CSU. After graduating, I joined Bamboo Rose (Backbone's parent company) 
          as a full stack engineer, where I'm building the next generation of our PLM system.

          Outside of work, I'm a husband, teach percussion at a local high school, and play drums for the Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets. I also 
          enjoy rock climbing, golf, skiing, and hiking around Colorado.
