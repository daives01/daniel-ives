    <p class="text-lg indent-4">
      Starting as an intern at Backbone PLM, I immersed myself in web development alongside my traditional CS education. Now I'm a full stack engineer
      at Bamboo Rose, the parent company of Backbone PLM, since graduating from CSU in May 2023.

    <p class="text-lg pt-4 indent-4">
      Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I play drums for Avalanche and Nuggets games, love to rock climb, golf, ski, and hike.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg pt-4 indent-4">
      I'm always striving to improve my skills and learn new things. I pride myself on being a natural leader, learning new things extremely quickly,
      and communicating effectively.
